# search_optimization.rb
# This Ruby script is designed to demonstrate a search algorithm optimization using the CUBA framework.
# It includes error handling, documentation, and follows Ruby best practices for maintainability and scalability.

# Usage: Running this script will start a CUBA application that listens for '/search?term=' requests.
# It will then execute the search and return the results in JSON format.
