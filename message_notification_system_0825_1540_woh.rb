# message_notification_system.rb

# This is a simple message notification system using Ruby and CUBA framework.
# It demonstrates how to structure a Ruby application with clear code,
# error handling, comments, and following Ruby best practices.

# Import necessary libraries
require 'cuba'
require 'json'
require 'httparty'
require 'openssl'
require 'base64'

# Initialize the Cuba application
Cuba.define do
  # Define a route to handle notification requests
  on post do
    on 'notify' do
      # Read the request body as JSON
      request_body = request.body.read
      data = JSON.parse(request_body)

      # Extract the message and recipient from the request data
      message = data['message']
      recipient = data['recipient']

      # Error handling for missing data
      if message.nil? || recipient.nil?
        halt 400, JSON.generate(error: 'Message and recipient are required')
      end

      # Send the notification to the recipient
      send_notification(message, recipient)

      # Respond with a success message
      res.write("Notification sent to #{recipient}")
    end
  end

  # Define the route to handle root path
  on root do
    res.write('Welcome to the Message Notification System!')
  end
end

# Function to send the notification
def send_notification(message, recipient)
  # This function should be implemented to send the notification to the recipient.
  # For simplicity, it's just printing the message to the console.
  # In a real-world application, you would integrate with an email service or messaging API.
  puts "Sending message to #{recipient}: #{message}"
rescue => e
  # Handle any exceptions that occur during notification sending
  puts "Error sending notification: #{e.message}"
end

# Run the application
run Cuba
