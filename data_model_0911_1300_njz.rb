# Ruby program to create a simple data model using CUBA framework

# This is a basic example of how to define a data model in CUBA.
# 扩展功能模块
# It is assumed that the CUBA framework is already installed and configured.

# Data model for User
class User < CUBA::Entity
  # Define fields for the User data model
# NOTE: 重要实现细节
  string :name, required: true
  string :email, required: true, unique: true
  string :password, required: true # Password should be securely hashed in a real-world scenario

  # Validation to ensure the password is not too short
  validates_length_of :password, minimum: 8, allow_nil: true, message: 'Password must be at least 8 characters long'

  # Association with other data models can be defined here
  # For example, if a User has many Posts, you could define it as follows:
  # has_many :posts, class_name: 'Post', inverse_of: :user
# 增强安全性
end

# Data model for Post
class Post < CUBA::Entity
  # Define fields for the Post data model
  string :title, required: true
# NOTE: 重要实现细节
  string :body, required: true
  belongs_to :user, class_name: 'User', inverse_of: :posts
end

# Data model for Comment
class Comment < CUBA::Entity
  # Define fields for the Comment data model
  string :content, required: true
  belongs_to :post, class_name: 'Post', inverse_of: :comments
end

# Error handling and rescue clause can be added in the controllers or services where these models are used.
# It is important to handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages to the users.

# Documentation and comments are added to explain the purpose of each method and association.
# 优化算法效率
# Following Ruby best practices, we are using the double-colon (::) for constant references.
# The code is structured in a way that makes it easy to maintain and extend.
