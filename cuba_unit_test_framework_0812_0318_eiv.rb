# This Ruby program demonstrates the creation of a simple unit test framework
# using the CUBA framework.

# The CUBA framework is a lightweight Ruby framework for building robust web applications.
# However, since CUBA is not specifically designed for unit testing, this example
# will focus on the structure and best practices for creating a unit testing
# framework in Ruby, while mentioning CUBA where applicable.

require 'cuba'
require 'cuba/proxy'
require 'cuba/test'
require 'minitest/autorun'

# Define a simple CUBA app for demonstration purposes
class MyApp
  include Cuba::DSL

  define do
    on root do
      res.write 'Hello, CUBA!'
    end
  end
end

# In a real-world scenario, you would use the CUBA app to define routes and
# handlers for your application. Here, we're focusing on the unit testing aspect.

# Define a simple example class to test
class SimpleCalculator
  def add(a, b)
    a + b
  end
end

# Minitest setup for the test cases
class SimpleCalculatorTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_addition
    calc = SimpleCalculator.new
    assert_equal 10, calc.add(5, 5)
  end
end

# In a CUBA app, you might have some routes that you'd want to test.
# Here's an example of how you might structure a test for a CUBA route.
class AppRouteTest < Minitest::Test
  def setup
    @app = MyApp
  end

  def test_root_route
    # Simulate a request to the root route
    response = Cuba::Proxy.new(@app).call({})
    assert_equal 'Hello, CUBA!', response[0]
  end
end

# Run the tests
Minitest.run
