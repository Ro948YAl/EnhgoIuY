# memory_usage_analyzer.rb
#
# This script analyzes the memory usage of a Ruby program using the CUBA framework.
# It provides a simple way to track memory usage and generate reports.

require 'cuba'
require 'memory_profiler'

# Initialize the Cuba app
Cuba.define do
  # Define a route to start the memory usage analysis
  on get do
    on 'analyze' do
      # Call the method to analyze memory usage
      analyze_memory_usage
    end
  end
end

# Method to analyze memory usage and generate a report
def analyze_memory_usage
  # Start memory profiling
  MemoryProfiler.start

  yield # The block of code to analyze

  # Stop memory profiling and generate the report
  MemoryProfiler.stop
  report = MemoryProfiler.report

  # Log the report to the console or save it to a file
  puts "Memory usage report:
#{report}"
rescue => e
  # Handle any errors that occur during the analysis
  puts "An error occurred during memory analysis: #{e.message}"
end

# Example usage: Analyze the memory usage of a block of code
if __FILE__ == $0
  # Start the Cuba app
  Cuba.run! port: 3000

  # Define a block of code to analyze
  code_to_analyze = Proc.new do
    # Simulate some memory-intensive operations
    large_array = Array.new(1000) { rand(1..1000) }
    complex_object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

  # Analyze the memory usage of the code block
